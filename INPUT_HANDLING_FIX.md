# Fix 6: Enhanced Input Handling with Unicode Support

## Overview
Enhanced the line editor with proper Unicode grapheme cluster support and additional keyboard shortcuts for improved usability, following standard terminal editing conventions.

## Problem Statement
The original input handling had several limitations:
1. **Basic Unicode support**: While char boundary checks prevented panics, cursor movement didn't properly handle grapheme clusters (emoji, combining characters)
2. **Missing shortcuts**: Lacked common editing shortcuts like Ctrl+W, Ctrl+U, Ctrl+K
3. **Limited word operations**: No word-based cursor movement or deletion
4. **Incomplete reverse search**: Ctrl+R was defined but not fully implemented

## Solution

### 1. Unicode Grapheme Cluster Support
Using the `unicode-segmentation` crate (already in dependencies):

```rust path=/home/quinton/openagent-terminal/src/line_editor.rs start=8
use unicode_segmentation::UnicodeSegmentation;
```

**Grapheme-aware cursor movement:**
- `move_cursor_left()`: Moves back one complete grapheme cluster
- `move_cursor_right()`: Moves forward one complete grapheme cluster
- Properly handles emoji (ðŸ‘‹, ðŸŽ‰), combining characters (cafÃ©), and complex scripts

**Grapheme-aware deletion:**
- `delete_grapheme_backward()`: Deletes one complete grapheme cluster backward
- `delete_grapheme_forward()`: Deletes one complete grapheme cluster forward
- Ensures emoji and combined characters are deleted as single units

### 2. Word-Based Operations
Using `unicode_word_indices()` for proper word boundary detection:

**Word movement:**
- **Ctrl+Left**: Move to beginning of previous word
- **Ctrl+Right**: Move to beginning of next word

**Word deletion:**
- **Ctrl+W**: Delete previous word (standard terminal behavior)

### 3. Line Editing Shortcuts
Following standard terminal/readline conventions:

| Shortcut | Action | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Ctrl+U** | Delete to start | Clear from cursor to beginning of line |
| **Ctrl+K** | Delete to end | Clear from cursor to end of line |
| **Ctrl+W** | Delete word | Delete previous word |
| **Ctrl+A** | Home | Move to start of line (existing) |
| **Ctrl+E** | End | Move to end of line (existing) |
| **Ctrl+L** | Clear screen | Clear terminal screen |
| **Ctrl+R** | Reverse search | Interactive history search (framework ready) |

### 4. Reverse Search Framework
Added infrastructure for reverse search (Ctrl+R):
- `start_reverse_search()`: Enter search mode
- `exit_reverse_search()`: Exit search mode
- `search_add_char()`: Add character to search query
- `search_backspace()`: Remove last search character
- `search_find_next()`: Find next matching history entry
- Currently shows placeholder UI; full interactive mode in future iteration

## Implementation Details

### EditorAction Enum Updates
```rust path=/home/quinton/openagent-terminal/src/line_editor.rs start=32
    ReverseSearch,
    /// Delete to beginning of line (Ctrl+U)
    DeleteToStart,
    /// Delete to end of line (Ctrl+K)
    DeleteToEnd,
    /// Delete previous word (Ctrl+W)
    DeletePrevWord,
```

### LineEditor State
Added reverse search state tracking:
```rust path=/home/quinton/openagent-terminal/src/line_editor.rs start=47
    /// Reverse search mode active
    reverse_search: bool,
    /// Reverse search query
    search_query: String,
    /// Reverse search result index
    search_result_idx: Option<usize>,
```

## Testing

### Comprehensive Test Suite
Added 8 new tests covering:

1. **test_unicode_emoji_navigation**: Emoji cursor movement
2. **test_delete_emoji**: Emoji deletion as single unit
3. **test_delete_prev_word**: Ctrl+W word deletion
4. **test_delete_to_start**: Ctrl+U line clearing
5. **test_delete_to_end**: Ctrl+K line clearing
6. **test_ctrl_w_delete_word**: Keyboard mapping verification
7. **test_ctrl_u_delete_to_start**: Keyboard mapping verification
8. **test_ctrl_k_delete_to_end**: Keyboard mapping verification
9. **test_word_movement**: Ctrl+Left/Right word navigation
10. **test_reverse_search_mode**: Ctrl+R mode toggling
11. **test_grapheme_cluster_deletion**: Combined character handling

## Usage Examples

### Unicode Text
```bash
# Type emoji - they work as single characters
> Hello ðŸ‘‹ World!
# Press Left - cursor jumps over entire emoji
> Hello ðŸ‘‹| World!
# Press Backspace - deletes entire emoji
> Hello | World!
```

### Word Operations
```bash
# Type multiple words
> git commit -m "message"
# Press Ctrl+W - deletes "message"
> git commit -m "
# Press Ctrl+W - deletes "-m "
> git commit 
```

### Line Editing
```bash
# Type a long command
> docker run -it --name mycontainer ubuntu:latest
# Press Home (Ctrl+A), then type "sudo "
> sudo docker run -it --name mycontainer ubuntu:latest
# Press Ctrl+K - deletes from cursor to end
> sudo |
```

## Benefits

1. **Correctness**: Proper Unicode handling prevents visual glitches with international text and emoji
2. **Efficiency**: Word-based operations speed up editing
3. **Familiarity**: Standard shortcuts match readline, bash, zsh behavior
4. **Accessibility**: Better support for international users and complex scripts
5. **Future-proof**: Framework in place for advanced features like reverse search

## Future Enhancements

1. **Full Reverse Search**: Complete interactive Ctrl+R implementation with real-time feedback
2. **Incremental Search**: Show matches as you type
3. **Alt-based shortcuts**: Alt+B/F for word navigation (if terminal supports)
4. **Kill Ring**: Implement kill/yank buffer for advanced editing
5. **Tab Completion**: Command and path completion

## Technical Notes

### Grapheme Clusters
A grapheme cluster is what a user perceives as a single character:
- Basic ASCII: `'a'` (1 byte)
- Emoji: `'ðŸ‘‹'` (4 bytes)
- Combined: `'Ã©'` can be `'e'` + combining acute (2 characters, 1 grapheme)
- Flags: `'ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸'` is 2 emoji combined (8 bytes, 1 grapheme)

### Word Boundaries
Word boundaries are determined by Unicode word segmentation rules:
- Handles ASCII: `"hello-world"` â†’ `["hello", "world"]`
- Handles Unicode: `"cafÃ©_rÃ©sumÃ©"` â†’ `["cafÃ©", "rÃ©sumÃ©"]`
- Respects punctuation and whitespace

## Compatibility

- **Terminals**: Works with any terminal supporting UTF-8
- **Shells**: Compatible with bash/zsh/fish shortcuts
- **Platforms**: Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- **Dependencies**: Uses existing `unicode-segmentation = "1.11"` from Cargo.toml
