# Real File Operations - Implementation Guide

**Date:** 2025-10-04  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented and Ready  
**Phase:** 5 Week 1

---

## Overview

The OpenAgent-Terminal tool system now supports **real file system operations** in addition to the safe demo mode. This feature allows tools to actually create, modify, and delete files on your system.

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** Real file operations can permanently modify your file system. Always review tool approval dialogs carefully!

---

## Execution Modes

### 1. Demo Mode (Default) üîí

**Safe for testing and development**

- No actual file modifications
- Operations are simulated
- Returns realistic responses
- Perfect for development and demos

**Usage:**
```bash
# Start backend in demo mode (default)
python -m openagent_terminal.bridge
```

**Behavior:**
- `file_read`: Actually reads files (safe)
- `file_write`: Simulates write, returns success message
- `file_delete`: Simulates deletion
- `shell_command`: Only executes safe commands (ls, pwd, date, whoami)
- `directory_list`: Actually lists directories (safe)

### 2. Real Execution Mode ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Actually modifies file system**

- Real file creation, modification, deletion
- Shell commands execute fully
- Requires explicit flag
- Safety checks enforced

**Usage:**
```bash
# Start backend with real execution enabled
python -m openagent_terminal.bridge --execute
```

**Behavior:**
- `file_read`: Reads entire file content
- `file_write`: **Actually writes files**
- `file_delete`: **Actually deletes files**
- `shell_command`: **Actually executes commands** (10s timeout)
- `directory_list`: Lists all files in directory

---

## Safety Features

### Path Sanitization

All file operations check if paths are safe using `_is_safe_path()`:

**Allowed:**
- Current working directory and subdirectories
- User home directory (~/...)
- Paths within these boundaries

**Blocked:**
- System directories: `/etc`, `/sys`, `/proc`, `/dev`, `/boot`
- Paths attempting directory traversal outside safe zones
- Root-level directories

**Example:**
```python
# ‚úÖ Allowed
/home/quinton/project/test.txt
./local/file.txt
~/documents/notes.md

# ‚ùå Blocked
/etc/passwd
/sys/kernel/config
../../../etc/shadow
```

### Tool Approval System

**Risk Levels:**
- **LOW** (Auto-approved): Read operations, directory listings
- **MEDIUM** (Requires approval): File writes
- **HIGH** (Requires approval + warning): File deletions, shell commands

**Approval Flow:**
1. Agent decides to use a tool
2. Backend checks risk level
3. If HIGH/MEDIUM ‚Üí Request user approval
4. User sees preview of operation
5. User approves/rejects
6. If approved ‚Üí Execute with safety checks
7. Return result

### Command Timeout

Shell commands have a 10-second timeout to prevent:
- Infinite loops
- Hanging processes
- Resource exhaustion

If a command exceeds 10 seconds, it's automatically terminated.

## Implementation Details

### Code Structure

**tool_handler.py:**
```python
class ToolHandler:
    def __init__(self, demo_mode: bool = True):
        """
        Initialize with execution mode.
        
        Args:
            demo_mode: True for safe simulation, False for real execution
        """
        self.demo_mode = demo_mode
        self.tools = self._register_tools()
    
    async def _execute_tool(self, tool, params):
        """Route to demo or real execution."""
        if self.demo_mode:
            return await self._execute_tool_demo(tool, params)
        else:
            return await self._execute_tool_real(tool, params)
    
    def _is_safe_path(self, path: str) -> bool:
        """Validate path is within safe directories."""
        abs_path = os.path.abspath(path)
        cwd = os.getcwd()
        home = os.path.expanduser("~")
        
        # Must be in CWD or home
        if not (abs_path.startswith(cwd) or abs_path.startswith(home)):
            return False
        
        # Block system directories
        forbidden = ["/etc", "/sys", "/proc", "/dev", "/boot"]
        for dir in forbidden:
            if abs_path.startswith(dir):
                return False
        
        return True
```

**bridge.py:**
```python
# Command-line argument parsing
parser.add_argument(
    "--execute",
    action="store_true",
    help="Enable REAL file operations (‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: modifies file system!)"
)

# Pass mode to tool handler
demo_mode = not args.execute
bridge = TerminalBridge(socket_path, demo_mode=demo_mode)
```

### Tool Implementations

#### file_write (Real Mode)
```python
async def _execute_tool_real(self, tool, params):
    if tool.name == "file_write":
        path = params.get("path", "")
        content = params.get("content", "")
        
        # Safety check
        if not self._is_safe_path(path):
            return {
                "success": False,
                "error": f"Access denied: {path} not in safe directory"
            }
        
        # Create directory if needed
        os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(path) or ".", exist_ok=True)
        
        # Write file
        with open(path, 'w') as f:
            f.write(content)
        
        return {
            "success": True,
            "message": f"Successfully wrote {len(content)} bytes to {path}",
            "path": os.path.abspath(path)
        }
```

#### file_delete (Real Mode)
```python
if tool.name == "file_delete":
    path = params.get("path", "")
    
    # Safety check
    if not self._is_safe_path(path):
        return {
            "success": False,
            "error": f"Access denied: {path} not in safe directory"
        }
    
    if os.path.exists(path):
        os.remove(path)
        return {
            "success": True,
            "message": f"Successfully deleted {path}"
        }
    else:
        return {
            "success": False,
            "error": f"File not found: {path}"
        }
```

#### shell_command (Real Mode)
```python
if tool.name == "shell_command":
    command = params.get("command", "")
    
    # Execute with timeout
    result = subprocess.run(
        command,
        shell=True,
        capture_output=True,
        text=True,
        timeout=10  # 10 second timeout
    )
    
    return {
        "success": result.returncode == 0,
        "stdout": result.stdout,
        "stderr": result.stderr,
        "returncode": result.returncode,
        "command": command
    }
```

## Usage Examples

### Demo Mode (Safe)

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start backend in demo mode
cd backend
python -m openagent_terminal.bridge

# Terminal 2: Run frontend
cd ..
cargo run --release
```

**Result:**
- File operations simulated
- No actual changes to file system
- Safe for testing and development

### Real Execution Mode (‚ö†Ô∏è Careful!)

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start backend with real execution
cd backend
python -m openagent_terminal.bridge --execute

# Terminal 2: Run frontend
cd ..
cargo run --release
```

**Result:**
- File operations actually execute
- Files created, modified, deleted
- Shell commands run for real
- Safety checks enforced

### Testing

```bash
# Run comprehensive test
./test_real_operations.sh

# This will:
# 1. Start backend with --execute
# 2. Run frontend
# 3. Verify file creation
# 4. Clean up
```

---

## Configuration

You can also configure execution mode in `~/.config/openagent-terminal/config.toml`:

```toml
[tools]
# Enable real file system operations
enable_real_execution = false  # Change to true for real mode

# Directories where tools are allowed to operate
safe_directories = [
    "~",     # Home directory
    ".",     # Current directory
]

# Timeout for shell commands in seconds
command_timeout = 10
```

**Note:** CLI flag `--execute` overrides config file setting.

---

## Security Considerations

### What's Protected ‚úÖ

1. **System Directories**
   - `/etc`, `/sys`, `/proc`, `/dev`, `/boot` are blocked
   - Prevents accidental system damage

2. **Path Traversal**
   - `../../../etc/passwd` is blocked
   - All paths resolved to absolute before checking

3. **Timeout Protection**
   - Commands limited to 10 seconds
   - Prevents runaway processes

4. **User Approval**
   - HIGH/MEDIUM risk tools require explicit approval
   - Preview shown before execution

### What's NOT Protected ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. **Within Safe Directories**
   - Files in home directory CAN be deleted
   - Working directory files CAN be modified
   - User must be careful with approvals

2. **Shell Commands**
   - Can execute ANY command (within safe dirs)
   - Limited only by timeout
   - User must review command text

3. **Resource Limits**
   - No memory limits
   - No disk space limits
   - No rate limiting

### Best Practices

1. **Always Review Approval Dialogs**
   - Read the preview carefully
   - Understand what will happen
   - When in doubt, reject

2. **Use Demo Mode for Testing**
   - Develop with demo mode
   - Only use real mode when needed
   - Test in isolated directories

3. **Backup Important Files**
   - Have backups before using AI tools
   - Test in non-critical directories first
   - Keep version control (git) active

4. **Monitor Tool Execution**
   - Watch what tools are doing
   - Check logs if something seems wrong
   - Cancel if unexpected behavior occurs

---

## Error Handling

### Common Errors

**"Access denied: X not in safe directory"**
- Path is outside allowed directories
- Solution: Move to home or working directory

**"File not found: X"**
- Attempting to read/delete non-existent file
- Solution: Check path, use directory_list first

**"Command timed out after 10 seconds"**
- Shell command took too long
- Solution: Optimize command, split into steps

**"Permission denied"**
- Insufficient file system permissions
- Solution: Check file permissions, use sudo if needed (careful!)

### Logging

Enable debug logging to see detailed execution:

```bash
python -m openagent_terminal.bridge --execute --debug
```

This shows:
- Every tool execution request
- Safety check results
- Approval flow
- Execution results

---

## Testing

### Unit Tests

```bash
# Python tests (needs pytest)
cd backend
pytest tests/test_tool_handler.py -v
```

### Integration Tests

```bash
# Test real file operations
./test_real_operations.sh

# Test demo mode (default)
./test_phase4.sh
```

### Manual Testing

```bash
# 1. Start backend with real execution
cd backend
python -m openagent_terminal.bridge --execute --debug

# 2. In another terminal, run frontend
cd ..
cargo run --release

# 3. Try a file write query:
#    "write hello world to test.txt"
#
# 4. Check if file was created:
ls -lh test.txt
cat test.txt

# 5. Clean up
rm test.txt
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned for Phase 5

1. **Enhanced Safety**
   - Whitelist/blacklist configuration
   - File size limits
   - Operation rate limiting

2. **Audit Trail**
   - Log all tool executions
   - Save operation history
   - Implement undo/redo

3. **Permissions System**
   - Check file permissions before operations
   - Respect read-only flags
   - Handle permission errors gracefully

4. **Advanced Operations**
   - File copy/move
   - Directory creation/deletion
   - Recursive operations
   - Batch operations

### Planned for Phase 6

1. **Sandboxing**
   - Execute in isolated environment
   - Use firejail or bubblewrap
   - Container-based execution

2. **Resource Limits**
   - Memory limits via cgroups
   - Disk space quotas
   - CPU usage limits

3. **Remote Execution**
   - Execute tools on remote machines
   - SSH-based tool execution
   - Distributed operations

## Troubleshooting

### Backend Won't Start with --execute

**Problem:** Backend fails when using `--execute` flag

**Solutions:**
1. Check Python version (3.9+ required)
2. Verify no syntax errors in tool_handler.py
3. Check file permissions on socket directory
4. Look at debug logs: `--execute --debug`

### Files Not Actually Created

**Problem:** Using `--execute` but files aren't created

**Solutions:**
1. Verify backend started with `--execute` flag
2. Check approval was given (not auto-rejected)
3. Verify path is in safe directory
4. Check file system permissions
5. Look at backend logs for errors

### Path Safety Checks Too Strict

**Problem:** Valid paths being rejected

**Solutions:**
1. Use absolute paths: `/home/quinton/file.txt`
2. Ensure CWD is set correctly
3. Add directories to `safe_directories` in config
4. Check logs to see why path rejected
