### Weaknesses Found ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. **Test Coverage** - Only 30% (need 70%+)
2. **Configuration** - All hardcoded (need TOML config)
3. **Mock Agent** - Not real LLM yet
4. **Demo Mode** - No real file operations yet
5. **Solo Project** - Bus factor = 1 (but excellent docs help)

### Opportunities üöÄ
1. **OpenAgent Integration** - Unique positioning with local LLMs
2. **Privacy Focus** - Alternative to closed-source cloud terminals
3. **Tool Safety** - Approval system is unique feature
4. **Open Source** - Community can contribute
5. **Self-Hosted** - Enterprise use cases

### Threats üõë
1. **Competition** - Warp (funded, mature) and others
2. **Fork Maintenance** - wezterm fork needs attention
3. **AI Evolution** - Fast-moving LLM landscape
4. **Development Pace** - Solo vs teams
